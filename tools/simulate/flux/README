To use Flux Simulator, follow these steps:

Before you do any runs:

1. Run 'make', which downloads and extracts Flux

If you want to do one or more runs w/r/t some iGenomes archive:

2. Set the IGENOMES_DIR environment variable to point to the directory where
   you've expanded the iGenomes archive.  I.e. IGENOMES_DIR directory should
   have a subdirectory for every species you have an iGenomes archive for.

3. Run 'sh igenomes_setup.sh' with appropriate arguments.  E.g. for the
   iGenomes dm3 archive:
   
   sh igenomes_setup.sh Drosophila_melanogaster UCSC dm3

If you want to customize how Flux Simulator runs:

4. Edit parameters/sailfish.par or make a new .par file

Finally:

5. Run flux-simulator:
   
   ./flux-simulator/bin/flux-simulator -p parameters/sailfish.par
   (or replace .par file with one you created)
